//! C02f-AQ bounded fence-sequence allocation reconciliation orchestration.
//!
//! This module owns one exact retained C02f-AJ allocation plan from first AP submission through
//! terminal reconciliation. It performs no initial head read, allocation planning, attempt-ID
//! generation, endpoint/client construction, credential lookup, TLS/auth/RBAC selection, recovery
//! execution, live-owner activation, or runtime activation. Any path that could deliberately reissue
//! the retained allocation first performs explicit fresh AP re-observation. Only fresh
//! `ProvenNotCommitted` may consume the existing one-reissue AJ budget, and there is no third-submit
//! path.
