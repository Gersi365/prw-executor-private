//! C02f-AO bounded fence-sequence initialization reconciliation orchestration.
//!
//! This module owns one exact retained C02f-AM initialization transaction plan from first AN
//! submission through terminal reconciliation. It performs no initial planning, endpoint/client
//! construction, credential lookup, TLS/auth/RBAC selection, sequence allocation, recovery
//! execution, or runtime activation. A mutation-indeterminate result is always freshly re-observed
//! before any retransmission. Only `ProvenNotCommitted` permits one deliberate exact reissue, and a
//! second non-commit proof can never cause a third submission.
