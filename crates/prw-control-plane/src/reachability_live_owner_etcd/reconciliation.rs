//! Phase 152 C02f-AE bounded indeterminate-mutation reconciliation orchestration.
//!
//! C02f-Z selected mandatory linearizable re-observation and no blind mutation retry. C02f-AB
//! materialized the deterministic `Committed` / `ProvenNotCommitted` / `Superseded` classifiers,
//! while C02f-AD materialized real etcd Get/Txn wiring and classifies non-definitive Txn RPC errors
//! as `MutationIndeterminate`.
//!
//! This module connects those already-selected pieces without selecting endpoints, TLS/auth/RBAC,
//! runtime ownership, background tasks, recovery/bootstrap, fence allocation or attempt-ID
//! generation. One top-level mutation may deliberately reissue the exact retained transaction at
//! most once, and only after a fresh linearizable exact-key observation proves the first attempt did
//! not commit.
