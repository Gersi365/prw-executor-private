//! Phase 152 C02f-BP dedicated first-owner etcd execution and bounded reconciliation.
//!
//! C02f-BO selected this provider-owned path for the already-prepared first-owner handoff. The
//! operation uses the existing [`ReachabilityLiveOwnerEtcdStore`] KV client, submits only the exact
//! retained `version == 0` create transaction, and performs mandatory fresh linearizable
//! re-observation before the one permitted exact reissue. It does not select endpoints, construct an
//! etcd client, allocate fences, generate attempt IDs, re-enter acquisition preparation, activate a
//! runtime, or compose the full asynchronous authority.
