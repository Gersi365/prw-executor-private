//! Phase 152 C02f-BD reconciled release provider execution composition.
//!
//! C02f-BC selected the exact release-side composition from one semantic live-owner grant through
//! the already-materialized C02f-AD linearizable read and C02f-AE bounded reconciliation into the
//! validated C02f-BB semantic mapper. This module materializes only that sequence.
//!
//! The caller supplies an already-created mutable `ReachabilityLiveOwnerEtcdStore`; this module does
//! not select endpoints, construct an etcd client, configure TLS/auth/RBAC, create a runtime/task,
//! allocate fences or attempt IDs, compose acquisition/currentness, activate R1-R4 effects, deploy,
//! or merge anything. Provider I/O occurs only when the returned future is polled.
