//! Phase 152 C02f-AY pure mapping from reconciled provider evidence to release semantics.
//!
//! C02f-AX selected the provider-neutral mapping from C02f-AE terminal release evidence to the
//! existing semantic release result. This module materializes only that deterministic translation.
//! It performs no provider I/O, transaction execution, re-observation, endpoint/client construction,
//! runtime ownership, retry/reissue, authority activation, R1-R4 effect fencing or deployment.
//!
//! C02f-BA adds provider-owned peer/fence evidence to the top-level `NotCurrent` variant. This file
//! changes only enough to remain compile-compatible with that payload shape: the payload is not
//! inspected or trusted for semantic success in BA, so the branch continues to fail closed.

/// Maps one exact semantic grant plus one terminal C02f-AE release result into release semantics.

/// C02f-BA binds the top-level `NotCurrent` result to provider-owned peer/fence evidence, but this
/// compatibility checkpoint deliberately does not consume that payload yet. The branch therefore
/// remains fail-closed until a later semantic checkpoint proves exact equality with the supplied
/// grant. For a resolved mutation, the retained successor must preserve the exact grant peer/fence
/// and must be `Released` before its terminal outcome is interpreted. `Committed` maps to `Released`,
/// `Superseded` maps to `NotCurrent`, and `CompareFailed` maps to `NotCurrent` only when the
/// authoritative failure observation deterministically proves the supplied grant stale.
/// Contradictory context fails closed.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Returns [`ReachabilityLiveOwnerAuthorityError::UnavailableOrAmbiguous`] for a bound top-level
/// `NotCurrent` that has not yet crossed the later semantic evidence-matching gate,
/// successor-context mismatch, a compare failure that still classifies the supplied grant as
/// current, or deterministic classifier rejection. Returns
/// [`ReachabilityLiveOwnerAuthorityError::FenceExhausted`] if the semantic fence cannot be
/// represented as the non-zero provider fence required for classification.
