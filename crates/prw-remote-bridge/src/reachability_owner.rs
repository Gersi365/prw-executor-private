//! Phase 152 C02e Tranche 4 production reachability composition owner.
//!
//! This module owns the one-shot composition boundary across authenticated candidate admission,
//! verifier-owned publication freshness, the current connectivity plan, durable compare-and-
//! commit, and at most one current Phase 141 Sans-I/O traversal session. It deliberately owns no

//! serialization format, database product, Agent bootstrap activation, or deployment behavior.
