//! Phase 152 C02f-Y asynchronous production live-owner authority port staging.
//!
//! This module materializes the C02f-X API/orchestration selection without activating a concrete
//! etcd endpoint, runtime, task, socket, TLS profile, storage schema or network effect. The existing
//! synchronous `reachability_live_owner` seam remains the deterministic/Sans-I/O semantic reference.
//!
//! The production port is intentionally separate and honest about asynchronous provider I/O:
//! methods return `impl Future + Send`, use static dispatch and initially borrow the authority with
//! `&mut self`. Provider-specific etcd code remains owned by `prw-control-plane`; this module owns
//! only the provider-neutral orchestration-facing contract.

/// Explicit asynchronous production authority port for one exact reachability live-owner lifecycle.
///
/// This port complements rather than replaces the synchronous semantic/reference seam. A production
/// provider may perform network I/O only after the returned Future is polled by an external executor.
/// The bridge itself does not own or create an async runtime by defining this trait.
///
/// Safety requirements inherited from the live-owner authority contract:
///
/// - every successful acquisition for one exact `DeviceId + TransportIdentity` namespace must use a
///   strictly newer authority fence than every prior successful generation for that namespace;
/// - ambiguous or unavailable provider state must fail closed;
/// - authoritative currentness cannot be proven from stale/local cache state or advisory watches;
/// - stale release must not clear a newer owner;
/// - dropping/cancelling a pending operation must never be interpreted as successful ownership;
/// - effect-side stale-fence rejection remains mandatory at R1-R4 and is not satisfied merely by
///   awaiting a bridge-level currentness check once.
///
/// The exact etcd key/value schema, Txn compare guard, indeterminate-commit reconciliation details,
/// TLS/auth/RBAC profile, recovery epoch provider and process-level executor remain separate gates.
