//! Phase 152 C02f-BQ reconciled replacement-acquisition provider execution composition.
//!
//! C02f-AW selected the exact evidence-continuity sequence from one retained C02f-AS acquisition
//! handoff through the already-materialized C02f-AE bounded provider reconciliation into the
//! validated C02f-AV semantic mapper. C02f-BS reuses the same terminal mapping through the narrow
//! preparation-owned acquisition-execution capability selected by C02f-BR.
//!
//! The existing public BQ entry point still accepts one already-created mutable
//! `ReachabilityLiveOwnerEtcdStore` plus one exact retained handoff. The BS crate-private entry point
//! accepts only the scoped preparation-owned acquisition-execution capability plus that same handoff.
//! Neither path selects endpoints, constructs a client, configures TLS/auth/RBAC, creates runtime
//! state, allocates fences/attempt IDs, retries outside AE, activates R1-R4, deploys, or merges.
