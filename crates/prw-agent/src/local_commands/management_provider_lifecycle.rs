//! C02c provider lifecycle ownership seam for local management.
//!
//! This module deliberately owns no production backend implementation and is not
//! wired into the local server loop. It composes already-existing provider-neutral
//! brokers around caller-supplied backends and the Agent-owned filesystem authority.
//! Clean completion is explicit: the lifecycle can be consumed successfully only
//! when no transfer, terminal, or forwarding resource remains active.
