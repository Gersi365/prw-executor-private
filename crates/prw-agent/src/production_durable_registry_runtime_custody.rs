//! Agent-owned runtime custody for one production durable-registry semantic store.
//!
//! C03e-JD materializes only the C03e-JC-selected side-effect-free ownership adaptation. One
//! already-produced [`DurableRegistryEtcdStore`] is consumed exactly once and retained privately by
//! Agent runtime custody for a later separately gated operation-specific use site.
//!
//! C03e-JF adds only the C03e-JE-selected operation-specific production peer-identity lookup. It
//! resolves one explicitly supplied logical [`DeviceId`] through the privately held durable registry's
//! authoritative current same-device transport binding and returns one [`PeerConnectivityIdentity`].
//!
//! C03e-KA adds only the C03e-JZ-selected dormant production durable capability-authority custody.
//! One existing durable-registry runtime custody is shared through one outer `Arc<Mutex<_>>` beside
//! the fixed fail-closed [`ProductionRemoteCapabilityDenyAllPolicy`].
//!
//! C03e-KC adds only the C03e-KB-selected dormant authorization invocation seam. It borrows one
//! existing post-auth capability transaction, acquires the existing durable-registry custody mutex,
//! invokes the existing provider-aware durable capability bridge exactly once, and releases the guard
//! before any downstream dispatch or response work.
//!
//! This module does not load credentials, bootstrap a provider, expose a generic store/executor
//! extraction seam, register global state, publish readiness, wire startup, create a background task,
//! activate networking, deploy, mutate registry state, or mutate production state.
