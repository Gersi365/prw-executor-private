//! Phase 152 C02f-CI Agent-owned reachability authority admission seam.
//!
//! C02f-CH preserves the existing local Agent readiness meaning and requires successful
//! reachability authority construction before future authority-dependent remote admission. This
//! module materializes the source-level admission token and callable bootstrap/admission seam.
//! C02f-CK additionally materializes the Agent-owned lifetime boundary for one admitted authority.
//! Neither path is wired into `main.rs`, runtime readiness, remote transport, or background/retry
//! lifecycle.
