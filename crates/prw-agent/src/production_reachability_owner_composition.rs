//! Agent-owned composition seam for one production reachability owner backed by the existing
//! durable-snapshot etcd executor.
//!
//! C03e-HO materializes only the C03e-HN-selected cross-crate handoff after control-plane provider
//! bootstrap has already narrowed a dedicated durable role connection to
//! `ReachabilityDurableSnapshotEtcdExecutor`. This module wraps that executor in the existing bridge
//! semantic store, creates the existing Agent-owned verifier freshness-token source, and moves both
//! directly into the existing Agent-owned custody recovery seam.
//!
//! This module does not connect to etcd, receive endpoints or credential material, expose a raw
//! `Client`/`KvClient`, create a fallback store or owner, spawn a task/runtime, publish readiness,
//! activate candidate publication or traversal, dial a peer, install a listener, mutate startup or
//! shutdown, deploy, or change production state.
